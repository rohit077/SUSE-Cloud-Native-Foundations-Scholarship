# **Transitions from VMs to Containers**

### **VMs**

In the past years, VMs (Virtual Machines) were the main mechanism to host an application. VMs encapsulate the code, configuration files, and dependencies necessary to execute the application.

The utilization of VMs introduced standardization in infrastructure provisioning, in association with efficient use of available infrastructure. Instead of running an application per server, a hypervisor enables multiple VMs to run at the same time to host multiple applications. However, there is one downside to this mechanism: it is not efficient enough. For example, applications A, B, and C uses the same Operating System. Replicating an OS consumes a lot of resources, and the more applications we run the more space we allocate to the replication of the operating systems alone.

****Containers****

The transition from VMs to containers

There was a clear need to optimize the usage of the available infrastructure. As a result, the virtualization of the Operating System was introduced. This prompted the appearance ofÂ **containers**, which represent the bare minimum an application requires for a successful execution e.g. code, config files, and dependencies. By default, there is a better usage of available infrastructure.

Multiple VMs on a hypervisor are replaced by multiple containers running on a single host operating system. The processes in the containers are completely isolated but are able to access the OS filesystem, resources, and packages. The creation and execution of containers is delegated to a container management tool, such as Docker.

The appearance of containers is unlocked by OS-level virtualization and as a result, multiple applications can run on the same OS. By nature, containers are lightweight, as these encapsulate only the application code and essential dependencies. Consequently, there is a better usage of available infrastructure and a more efficient pathway to release a product to consumers.

## Docker

- Docker Files: A Docker-file is a set of instructions used to create a Docker image. Each instruction is an operation used to package the application, such as installing dependencies, compile the code, or impersonate a specific user. A Docker image is composed of multiple layers, and each layer is represented by an instruction in the Docker-file. All layers are cached and if an instruction is modified, then during the build process only the changed layer will be rebuild. As a result, building a Docker image using a Docker-file is a lightweight and quick process.

To construct a Docker-file, it is necessary to use the pre-defined instructions, such as:

```docker
FROM -  to set the base image
RUN - to execute a command
COPY & ADD  - to copy files from host to the container
CMD - to set the default command to execute when the container starts
EXPOSE - to expose an application port
```

### Code to create a Docker-file that targets to package a Python hello-world application:

```docker
# set the base image. Since we're running 
# a Python application a Python base image is used
FROM python:3.8
# set a key-value label for the Docker image
LABEL maintainer="Katie Gamanji"
# copy files from the host to the container filesystem. 
# For example, all the files in the current directory
# to the  `/app` directory in the container
COPY . /app
#  defines the working directory within the container
WORKDIR /app
# run commands within the container. 
# For example, invoke a pip command 
# to install dependencies defined in the requirements.txt file. 
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
# provide a command to run on container start. 
# For example, start the `app.py` application.
CMD [ "python", "app.py" ]
```

- Docker Image: Once a Docker-file is constructed, these instructions are used to build a Docker image. A Docker image is a read-only template that enables the creation of a runnable instance of an application. In a nutshell, a Docker image provides the execution environment for an application, including any essential code, config files, and dependencies.

A Docker image can be built from an existing Dockerfile using the docker build command. Below is the syntax for this command:

```docker
# build an image
# OPTIONS - optional;  define extra configuration
# PATH - required;  sets the location of the Dockefile and  any referenced files 
docker build [OPTIONS] PATH

# Where OPTIONS can be:
-t, --tag - set the name and tag of the image
-f, --file - set the name of the Dockerfile
--build-arg - set build-time variables

# Find all valid options for this command 
docker build --help

# build an image using the Dockerfile from the current directory
docker build -t python-helloworld .

# build an image using the Dockerfile from the `lesson1/python-app` directory
docker build -t python-helloworld lesson1/python-app
```

Code to build the image of the Python hello-world application from the Docker-file:

```docker
# build an image using the Dockerfile from the current directory
docker build -t python-helloworld .

# build an image using the Dockerfile from the `lesson1/python-app` directory
docker build -t python-helloworld lesson1/python-app
```

- Docker Registry: Containers are small & manageable units that have an application running inside. It can be deployed fast & resiliently, fits well with a microservice-based architecture.
